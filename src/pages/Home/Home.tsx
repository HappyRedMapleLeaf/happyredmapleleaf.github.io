                    A Quick Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having just graduated from Dr. Norman Bethune CI, I’m now heading into the University of Waterloo’s computer engineering program. Eventually, I hope to work with low-level software, and I’m especially interested in robotics. Perhaps my robotics addiction will go away soon, but I don’t think it will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also love the outdoors (engineering student touching grass? impossible) and I enjoy camping, fishing, snowboarding, and going on nice little walks or bike rides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spend a lot of my time working on a variety of personal projects, from woodworking to, well, website development. Check out a detailed timeline of my projects on the Projects page! Most of them aren't very significant or impressive, but I'm happy with them anyways. I also make music or art from time to time, but it's certainly not very good and I just do it for fun.

                    What's Up With the Username?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s a long story that I don't completely remember, but my fourth grade self needed a new name for my YouTube channel… that had about 2 videos on it. I guess I felt particularly Canadian that day, and I held on to the “Happy Red Maple Leaf” username ever since. I’ve also made some graphics over the years to serve as profile pictures, banners, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I occasionally use the YouTube channel to dump gaming videos or quick showcases on any project, big or small, that I end up finishing.
